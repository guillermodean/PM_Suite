## Features

1. **Organize Desktop:** Keep your desktop clutter-free by letting PM Suite organize your files into mysterious folders. You won't remember where anything is, but hey, it's organized!

2. **List Organize Desktop:** Wondering where your files went? Use this feature to list the folders you didn't know you needed.

3. **Pomodoro Timer:** Boost your productivity for the 5 minutes you can stay focused. After that, well, there's always next time.

4. **Tasks:** Because every PM needs a list of tasks, even if they're not entirely sure what those tasks are.

5. **Encrypt:** Encrypt your most crucial project data using the most sophisticated encryption algorithm: PM-grade encryption. It's so secure even you won't be able to decrypt it.



### TODO
